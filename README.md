## VM Setup
A virtual machine is available to complete this assessment, though you are not required to use it. To access the VM, navigate to [sagence.cloud.com](sagence.cloud.com) and log in using your Sagence webmail credentials. You will be prompted to "Detect Workspace" and download the Citrix Workspace application. You may have trouble logging in if you have never reset your Sagence credentials. Please email [training@sagenceconsulting.com](mailto:training@sagenceconsulting.com) with any issues accessing the virtual machine.

If the Workspace application download does not automatically start, here are download links:
   * [Windows download](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/windows/workspace-app-for-windows-latest.html)
   * [Mac download](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/mac/workspace-app-for-mac-latest.html)

## Exercises

### Excel
For the following exercises, you will use Excel to manipulate Chicago city salaries data and extract information. Store answers to the questions in an Excel tab called "Answers". Format your answers as table that could be presented to a client.

#### Data
To get the complete salaries data, it is recommended that you use this [API endpoint](https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/xzkq-xp2w/rows.csv). If your download does not start automatically, navigate to the link by pasting it into your browser.

1. Using Excel pivot tables, answer the following questions:
    * How many paid employees does City of Chicago have?
    * How many salaried employees are there?
    * How many hourly employees are there?

2. Use an in-line formula to split the names into first names, last names, and middle initials. Then answer the following questions:
    * What is the most common last name?
    * What percentage of employees have no middle initial?

3. Write a simple macro to create a new sheet with only police and fire department employees.
    * How many emergency responders does the city employ?

There have been some updates to the salary information because some employees received a raise. The updated salaries for each employee are stored in a GitHub repository. Download the new salaries data from the repository [here](https://github.com/sagencetraining/assessment_level_one).

4. Merge the new salaries with the salaries data downloaded earlier.

5. Using the merged dataset, answer the following questions:
    * What department has the most employees?
    * Which departments have the highest average salaries?
    * What is the average salary for Chicago police officer?

6. Save your edited spreadsheet as a file called `salaries_analysis.xlsx`.

### SQL
For the following exercises, you will use SQL to query the 2003-2015 American Time Use Survey (ATUS). Use SQLite in a command line shell or a SQLite database browser to perform the exercises that follow. Store answers to the questions as comments accompanying your SQL scripts in a file called `atus_queries.sql`.

#### Data
Download the SQLite database [here](https://sagence.egnyte.com/dl/CF2KyiTbhw). 

Download [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).

You may find the ATUS [Data Dictionary](https://www.bls.gov/tus/atuscpscodebk16.pdf) and [Lexicon](https://www.bls.gov/tus/lexiconwex2016.pdf) useful.

1. What state has the lowest proportion of people who are high school graduates?

    Hint: You can look up the state codes [here](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ansi_statetables.html).

2. What proportion of respondents who are eligible to work did work last week?

    Hint: When `worked_last_week` > 2, the respondent is retired/disabled/unable to work and so should be excluded in this question.

3. Group your answer to (2) by whether or not the respondent has a spouse or partner in their household.

    Hint: `spouse_or_partner_present`, see `TRSPPRES` in the codebook.

4. How many hours on average are spent playing video games (code 120307) by men and women (`edited_sex` 1 and 2) and by age decade (10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc.)?

    Hint: To group by age decade, use the fact that the default integer division in SQL is floor division.

5. How many hours are spent on average on household activities, by sex and educational attainment?

6. Save your queries and commented answers as a file called `atus_queries.sql`.
